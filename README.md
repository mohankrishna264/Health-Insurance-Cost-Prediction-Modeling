# Health Insurance Cost Prediction Modeling

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting health insurance costs incurred by individuals based on several factors such as:
- Customer Age
- Gender
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Number of Dependents
- Smoking Status
- Location

The objective is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the insurance cost based on these variables.

## Features
- **customer_age**: The age of the insurance holder.
- **gender**: The gender of the insurance holder (male/female).
- **body_mass_index**: The BMI of the individual (a value between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered ideal).
- **dependents**: Number of dependents covered by the insurance.
- **smoking_status**: Whether the individual is a smoker or not.
- **location**: The region of the beneficiary's residence (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
- **insurance_cost**: The medical costs billed by the health insurance provider.

## Workflow
The process for building this model includes:
1. Data Collection
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation
